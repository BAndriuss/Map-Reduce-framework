# Vinted Homework Task

This is a simple implementation of my own map-reduce framework  

I have created a couple of versions for this framework, but I went with the one that is making new files for intermediate data. I
think this is the most optimal solution keeping in mind that the given data was supposed to be a lot bigger in a realistic situation

# How to use

For script to work there must be *"project/data/total_clicks/"* and *"project/temp/"* directories  
Note that *"map_rez.txt"* and *"country.txt"* are being appended, so everytime script is executed the files must be **deleted**
